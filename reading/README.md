| **Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set** by Jon Duckett | **MY ABSOLUTE TOP PICK FOR WEBDEV.** This is a set that combines 2 books for a cheaper price. *Both books are excellent: very visual, easy to look up things in, and get straight to the point without a lot of blah blah.* |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction** | **MY TOP PICK FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL.** This book is a timeless classic that will teach you the "art and science of software construction". It will *mature* you as a software developer and how you approach software solutions you yourself develop. *In my opinion, required reading for any software developer**,* *experienced or beginner**.* |
| **Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship**   | **MY TOP PICK FOR EVERYDAY CODING PRACTICES.** This book is another classic similar to "Code Complete" book, but goes into the details of how to actually do the coding well. While the "Code Complete" book will mature you in general software approaches, this one zones in on day to day coding practices. I've seen a lot of software that was easier to just dump and re-write from scratch than update. All because the original developers did not follow the basic principles this book advocates. What does "good code" or "clean code" even mean? Read this book and find out! *In my opinion, required reading for any software developer,* *experienced or beginner**.* |
| **Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual**        | **MY TOP PICK FOR GENERAL CAREER GUIDANCE FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.** I just recently finished this book and it's absolutely invaluable advice for any software developer, especially someone starting out. It's an "eye opener". It's an easy read (or listen to audio version). It provides a holistic approach to life in general with a twist that's applicable to software developers. Like in any profession, in software there is more to *being successful* than just the skill of writing good code. The book goes through tons and tons of topics from different types of software jobs (with their advantages and disadvantages) to *drastically increasing your productivity* & how to form good habits. It's definitely going on my list of *"Required reading for any software developer, experienced or beginner."* |
| **Mastering Sublime Text**by Dan Peleg                       | Clear, step by step instructions. *Covers Sublime Text 3!*   |
| **Pragmatic Guide to Git**                                   | **MY TOP PICK FOR GIT.** I am a BIG fan of pretty much any Pragmatic programming series book. This one is great as well! *Explains the concepts well, so you are not just memorizing commands.* |
